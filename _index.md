Welcome to the OpenBlox game engine documentation. Here you will find documentation for creating games with the OpenBlox engine. If you're looking for documentation of the C++ API, please consult [the latest Doxygen build](https://ci.openblox.org/job/libopenblox/doxygen/index.html).

The OpenBlox engine is meant to be easy to use, so having good documentation is important to us. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact us on one of the relevant [mailing lists](https://lists.openblox.org/).
